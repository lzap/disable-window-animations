DISABLE-WINDOW-ANIMATIONS

Works with Gnome Shell 3.0-3.2.

This extension simply disable all window manager animations.

 * Window "slide-ins"
 * Workspace "slide-ups" and "slide-downs"
 * Many more... :-)

However it does NOT disable dash animations ("zoom-ins" and 
"zoom-outs" etc.)

INSTALLATION:

Create a folder in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
called disable-window-animations@github.com and move
extension.js and metadata.json into that folder. Restart
the gnome-shell. 

FUTURE:

Please note there is ongoing process to enable Gnome Shell to 
load GConf setting for this. This extension will be unsupported 
then. But the patch is not in the Gnome master yet, we will be
releasing new versions until it gets in the stable.
