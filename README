DISABLE-WINDOW-ANIMATIONS

Works with Gnome Shell 3.0-3.2 (Fedora, Ubuntu, anything...)

This extension simply disable all window manager animations.

 * Window "slide-ins"
 * Workspace "slide-ups" and "slide-downs"
 * Many more... :-)

However, it does NOT disable dash animations ("zoom-ins" and 
"zoom-outs" etc.)

INSTALLATION:

Create a folder in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
called disable-window-animations@github.com and move
extension.js and metadata.json into that folder. Restart
the gnome-shell:

  # mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions 2>/dev/null
  # git clone git://github.com/lzap/disable-window-animations \
    ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/disable-win-anims@github.com

Alt-F2 and "r" ENTER

For Gnome Shell 3.2 you also need to turn the extension on. The easiest 
way to do that is to install gnome-tweak-tool and go to Shell Extensions
settings screen and turn it on (the switch-"thing" must have "I" on it).

FUTURE:

Please note there is ongoing process to enable Gnome Shell to 
load GConf setting for this. This extension will be unsupported 
then. But the patch is not in the Gnome master yet, we will be
releasing new versions until it gets in the stable AND Fedora.
